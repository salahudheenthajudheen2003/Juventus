<h3>Fulham's messageto JUVENTUS signing Matthijs De Ligt !!</h3>
<img src="index.jpeg" height=200px width=400px id ="ff">
<p>
<marque>Former Fulham goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar has seen his message to Juventus signing Matthijs De Ligt hijacked by his old club following the defender's departure from Ajax.
</marque>
<br>

The 19-year-old captain of the Amsterdam club has been one of the most wanted players in Europe this summer. Standing at six-foot-two and strong in both the air and on the ball, he is tipped to make a major impact at his next club.
<br>

A runner-up in the Europa League in 2017, and a member of young and exciting team that reached the last four of the Champions League last season in a campaign that saw them lift the Dutch title and the Dutch Cup, he leaves Ajax as a fan favourite and with the best wishes of the club hierarchy.
